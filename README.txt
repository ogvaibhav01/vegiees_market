Vegiees Market
==============

This is my second project from The Odin Project.  
I created a website where users can browse vegetables ("vegiees") from home as the project theme.

Features:
- Browse a selection of fresh vegetables

This project helped me practice HTML and CSS fundamentals.  
Note: This project does not include JavaScript and is for demonstration purposes only.

How to use:
1. Open the project in your browser.
2. Explore the available vegetables.

Thank you for visiting Vegiees Market!
